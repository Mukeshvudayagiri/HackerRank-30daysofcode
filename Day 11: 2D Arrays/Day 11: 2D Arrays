Objective
Today, we are building on our knowledge of arrays by adding another dimension. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

Context
Given a 6X6 2D Array, A:

1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0

We define an hourglass in A to be a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in A's graphical representation:

a b c
  d
e f g

There are 16 hourglasses in A, and an hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values.

Task
Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in A, then print the maximum hourglass sum.
